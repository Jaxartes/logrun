Installation instructions for "logrun".

1. You need to have "cmake" installed.  See https://cmake.org/.

2. You need the "logrun" source code.

3. "cd" to the source code directory.

4. Do the following commands:
    cd Build
    cmake ..
    make
    make test
    make install

You can optionally do 'make test' to perform some simple automated tests.

If you want to install to a different directory than the default,
replace "cmake .." with the following:
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/the/path/where/stuff/goes ..
files will be placed in 'bin' and 'man' subdirectories under the given
path.

If you don't have "cmake" available on your machine, you can do the
following:
    copy Makefile.canned -> Makefile
    copy logrun_config.h.canned -> logrun_config.h
    edit Makefile as appropriate for your system
    edit logrun_config.h as appropriate for your system
    run "make"
    run "make install"
    run "make install_man"
But "cmake" is preferred.
